# Tutorial 3: Inference with pre-trained models

MMagic provides Hign-level APIs for you to easily play with state-of-the-art models on your own images or videos.

Please follow our [tutorials](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmagic/blob/main/demo/mmagic_inference_tutorial.ipynb) to learn to use inference API `MMagicInferencer`. You can also use one line of command to run our demos [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmagic/blob/main/demo/README.md).

If you want to use deprecated demos, please use [MMagic v1.0.0rc7](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmagic/tree/v1.0.0rc7) and reference the [old tutorial](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmagic/blob/v1.0.0rc7/docs/en/user_guides/inference.md).
